This time, I will document everything I do, so I can take this as a guide in the future.

## Installing




## A Few Notes

* The latest Android SDK Tools(r26) are not compatible with Unity. You must switch back to r25.2.5 or something around that.

* If you wanna log Unity on Android, use Android Studio and open View - Tool Windows - Logcat.

* I switched to SRS, which is much easier to set up. [SRS](https://github.com/ossrs/srs)
